### How to Use Simple Media Manager
When you run the program, it will ask for a two-letter command.
You can enter many two-letter commands at once.
When an error occurs, the program skips rest of the input.
The first letter is an action letter, and the second letter is an object word. 

Action Letters:
```
f - find (for records only)
p - print
m - modify (for rating only)
l - list
a - add
d - delete
c - clear, collection or combine
s - save
r - restore
```

Object Letters:
```
r - an individual record or rating
c - an individual collection
m - member for the add and delete commands
s - string or statistics
t - title
L - the Library - the set of all individual records
C - the Catalog - the set of all individual collections
A - all data - both the Library and the Catalog - for the clear, save and restore commands
a - allocations in the print command (memory information)
```

Possible Parameters:
```
<title> - a title string which is entered with whitespace before, after, and internally, but
is always terminated by a newline character. Case sensitive

<ID> - a record number which must be an integer value

<name> - a collection name which consists of any non-whitespace characters and terminates with
a whitespace character. Case sensitive

<medium> - a medium name which consists of any non-whitespace characters with no embedded 
whitespace characters and terminates with a whitespace character. Case sensitive

<rating> - a rating value which must be an integer value in the range 1 through 5 inclusive.
Initially, ratings are zero which means they are unrated.

<filename> - a file name for which the program's data is to be written to or saved from. No embedded
whitespace characters, entered as a whitespace-delimited string.
```
